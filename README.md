Submission Guidelines:

1. You can code all of them either in Python or Java. But you should choose a specific language for all tasks.

2. For Problem 2a, write down the explanations in your copy, create a pdf file with the images of your hand written answers and name it explanation2a.pdf. For problem 2b, you need to download the image(.png) of the graph with a value of n good enough to differentiate between the two implementations. Name it problem2b.png.

3. Apart from problem 2, for each task write separate python files like task1.py, task3.py and so on.

4. For each problem, take input from files called “inputX.txt”, and output at “outputX.txt”, where X is the task number. So, for problem 2, the input file is basically this, “input2.txt”. Same for output.

5. For each task include the input files (if any) in the submission folder.

6. Finally zip all the files and rename this zip file as per this format:

LabSectionNo_ID_CSE221LabAssignmentNo_Fall2022.zip. [Example:

LabSection01_21101XXX_CSE221LabAssignment01_Fall2022.zip]

7. You MUST follow all the guidelines, and naming/file/zipping convention stated above. Failure to do so will result in a straight 50% mark deduction.

Task 1: File I/O

a) You are given a file “input1a.txt”. The first line of the input file will contain an integer T, representing the number of test cases. The next T lines will contain an integer N. You have to calculate if the number is Odd or Even. For each test case print the expected output. All the results must be compiled in a single file, “output1a.txt.”

Sample Input File Sample Output File

5

10

19

7

3

100 10 is an Even number.

19 is an Odd number.

7 is an Odd number.

3 is an Odd number.

100 is an Even number.

b) You are given a file “input1b.txt”. The first line of the input file will contain an integer T, representing the number of test cases. The next T lines will contain a single arithmetic expression. Each arithmetic expression will start with the prefix “calculate“. It is guaranteed that the expression will have exactly two operands and one operator.

Calculate the result based on the operation (operator) on the operands and for each line of expression, write the result with “The result of $a $operator $b is $result” where $a and $b are the values of the first and second operator respectively, and $operator is the operator and $result is the result of the operation. All the results must be compiled in a single file, “output1b.txt.”

The result of 99 – 95 is 4

The result of 3 / 10 is 0.3

The result of 12 * 19 is 228

The result of 14 – 6 is 8

The result of 3 * 88 is 264

The result of 45 * 68 is 3060

The result of 81 – 0 is 81

The result of 77 + 40 is 117

The result of 8 * 84 is 672

The result of 73 – 22 is 51

The result of 85 – 86 is -1

The result of 28 * 58 is 1624

Task 2: Time Complexity Analysis

a) You are given two different codes for finding the n-th Fibonacci number. Find the time complexity of both implementations and compare the two.

Implementation 1

def fibonacci_1(n):

if n &lt; 0:

print(“Invalid input!”)

elif n &lt;= 1:

return n

else:

return fibonacci_1(n-1)+fibonacci_1(n-2)

n = int(input(“Enter a number: “)) nth_fib = fibonacci_1(n)

print(“The {} th fibonacci number is {}.”.format(n, nth_fib))

Implementation 2

def fibonacci_2(n):

if n&lt;0: return “Invalid Input” if n&lt;=1:

return n

fib = [0] * (n+1) fib[0] = 0 fib[1] = 1 for i in range(2,n+1):

fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]

return fib[n]

n = int(input(“Enter a number: “)) nth_fib = fibonacci_2(n) print(“The {} th fibonacci number is {}.”.format(n, nth_fib))

b) Append the following code segment after the implementations given in the previous problem. [Yes, The code is given. Just Copy-Paste it]. This will generate a graph with the value of n along the x-axis and the time required along the y-axis. You can see both curves in the same graph for better comparison. Generate graphs for different values of n and see how the performances change drastically for larger values of n.

import time import math import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

#change the value of n for your own experimentation n = 30

x = [i for i in range(n)] y = [0 for i in range(n)] z = [0 for i in range(n)] for i in range(n-1): start = time.time() fibonacci_1(x[i+1]) y[i+1]= time.time()-start start = time.time() fibonacci_2(x[i+1]) z[i+1]= time.time()-start

x_interval = math.ceil(n/10) plt.plot(x, y, ‘r’) plt.plot(x, z, ‘b’) plt.xticks(np.arange(min(x), max(x)+1, x_interval)) plt.xlabel(‘n-th position’) plt.ylabel(‘time’) plt.title(‘Comparing Time Complexity!’) plt.show()

Task 3:

Here is the code of bubble sort. Its run time complexity is θ(n2). Change the code in a way so that its time complexity is θ(n) for the best-case scenario.

You have to explain how you have achieved the θ(n) for the best-case scenario in a comment block of your code.

def bubbleSort(arr):

for i in range(len(arr)-1):

for j in range(len(arr)-i-1):

if arr[j] &gt; arr[j+1]: arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

Input 1:

5

3 2 1 4 5 Output 1:

1 2 3 4 5

Input 2:

6

5 10 15 20 25 30 Output 2:

5 10 15 20 25 30

For the input 2, your code should run at θ(n).

Task 4:

However, you have to keep in mind that your sorting algorithms perform the minimum number of swapping operations.

Input:

The first line of the input file will contain an integer N ( 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 ).

The second line will contain N integers, representing the Student ID, Si ( 1 ≤ Si ≤ 1000 ). The next line will contain the N integer, Sm ( 1 ≤ Sm ≤ 1000 ), which denotes the obtained mark of the corresponding students.

Output:

Input 1:

7 4 9 3 2 5 1

40 50 50 20 10 10 10 Output 1:

ID: 4 Mark: 50

ID: 9 Mark: 50

ID: 7 Mark: 40

ID: 3 Mark: 20

ID: 1 Mark: 10

ID: 2 Mark: 10

ID: 5 Mark: 10

Input 2:

7 2 5 3

80 60 80 50 Output 2:

ID: 5 Mark: 80

ID: 7 Mark: 80

ID: 2 Mark: 60

ID: 3 Mark: 50

Task 5:

You have been recently recruited as the Software Engineer at Jumanji Railway Software System. You have a big task at hand. You will be given the N ( 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 ) schedule of the train. The next N line will contain the name of the train and the departure time. See the input format for better understanding.

Your task is to write a sorting algorithm that will group the trains in the lexicographical order based on the name of the trains. If two or more trains have the same name, then the train with the latest departure time will get prioritized. If there is still a tie, then the train which comes first in the input file will come first.
